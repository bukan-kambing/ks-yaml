<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

YAML is a data serialization language that often used for writing configuration files. It is designed in a way that makes it easy for developers to quickly write configuration files using a syntax that might be familiar to developers well-versed in indentation based languages such as Python.

However, this reliance on indentation oftentimes lead to problems due to parsing errors caused by inconsistent usage of tabs and spaces. We argue that it also causes readability problems when defining configurations that requires multiple levels of nested indentations, hence more often than not causing headaches for developers.

The KS-YAML formatting rules aims to solve this problem by leveraging the fact that YAML is designed as a superset of the JSON standard to create a more sensible way of writing YAML files.
